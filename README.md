responsive-wedding
------------------

An HTML5 responsive design using jquery waypoints & scroll-to for a pleasant single-page navigation. This template makes use of media queries and scales well for all mobile form-factors.

This site was modified from the great template at [responsive-wedding](https://github.com/bmgdev/responsive-wedding) by Bradley Greenwood.

I modified things a bit and added the gallery plugin.
